This mini-project that is part of Udacity's Front-Web Developer program will help me become better at building and organizing JavaScript code with and without libraries and frameworks like JQuery and KnockoutJS respectively.

As a result, I will practise:
* Events
* Event listeners
* Closures
* Separation of Concerns using the Model View Object technique
* Finally, I'll use one of the MV* libraries, i.e. KnockoutJS, to better organize my code.
